## Modularity, Objects, and State
- One powerful strategy is to base the structure of our programs on the structure of the system being modeled.
- Objects: viewing a large system as a collection of distinct objects whose behaviors may change over time.
- Streams: concentrates on the streams of information that follow in the system.

### Assignment and Local State
- we characterize an object's state by one or more state ***variables***, which among them maintain enough information about history to determine the object's current behavior.
